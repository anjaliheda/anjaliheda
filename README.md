## Projects:

### [Load Balancer - Pure Storage](https://github.com/anjaliheda/Load-Balancer)
The **Load Balancer** project is designed to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers, ensuring no single server gets overwhelmed. This project simulates the behavior of a load balancer that optimally redirects traffic to the least busy servers, increasing the efficiency and reliability of web applications. The implementation includes various algorithms like round-robin, source-hashing and least-connections to test the scalability and performance of different load-balancing strategies.

### [Research Paper Repository](https://github.com/anjaliheda/Research-Paper-Repository)
The **Research Paper Repository** is a centralized platform where users from RVCE can store and view published research papers. The system supports user authentication with role-based access control for author, student and admin. It helps manage and share research papers with features like paper upload, search, and view options, making academic sharing seamless and organized.

### [Heat Hazard Assistant](https://github.com/anjaliheda/Heat-Hazard-Assistant)
**Heat Hazard Assistant** is a smart web-based assistant that predicts heat-related health risks using weather data and personal factors. Built with React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase, it delivers real-time alerts and personalized safety tips, aiming to reduce heatwave-related harm through AI-driven decision logic and responsive design.

### [SketchSense AI](https://github.com/anjaliheda/SketchSense-AI)
**SketchSense AI** is an AI-powered tool designed to convert images into pencil sketches. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the project automatically transforms any uploaded image into a detailed sketch. The tool aims to make art creation more accessible and allows users to explore artistic expression through technology.
